# Train-Scheduler
Train-Scheduler is a train scheduling application built primarily through Google Firebase and Moment.js that allows users to add or remove their own train to the database. When adding new input, the application renders train schedule information in real time thanks to the Firebase's dynamic database system as well as the accurate time information Moment.js provides.
